title: FAQs about my launcher

Back in 2021, I started developing an android launcher. But for some unfortunate reason, I couldn't able to make it ready to release it yet. So now, I came up here with the answers of some common questions that might bother you.

##### What is the name of this launcher?
When at the primary phase of building, I wasn't sure what to name it. I wanted a name that would sound calm and peaceful. But after some struggle, I have decided to call it **Lunar Launcher**.

Before this, I had almost made it final to call it **Zebra Home** as this launcher is mainly based on two colors like a Zebra, white and black. So I had also created an launcher icon too with a Zebra head on it.

##### When is it going to be get released?
Still I am not sure about that. Because I discontinued this project a while ago, and in the meantime I have been working on some other open-source projects (e.g. [crushr](https://github.com/iamrasel/crushr)). I have also started developing a new app named **droidNerd**. So I don't think I can be able to continue 'Lunar Launcher' very soon.

##### Is there any possibility to make this project open-source?
I can't say that there isn't any chance. I might make the repository public in near future. But now I can't do that as the codes are so messy and I feel ashamed of it.

##### Off: What about droidNerd?
Please keep some patience, I will publish the codes from the very beginning of the build. So you will be able to contribute if you want to. Now I can only assure you that, this app will be a little 'nerdy' type for your non-rooted android device and let you do some extensive actions. It's all for now.
